			<p class="indent">Hello everybody!<br>
I’m a cat. My name is Felix. Now I live in Israel. Before that I lived in Russia. I am the most important member in the family. I have 3 human pets. My family is friendly. There are four members in my family. They are my mom, dad, their daughter Valeria and I - The Best Cat in the World! 
I have a father. His name is Alexander. He is very busy and works a lot. I don’t know what is «devops», but he’s doing it for me.</p> 
<p>I like comfort and good food.
I have a mom. Her name is Elena, but we call her a «bird». She is always near. So I named my blog «Near Bird».
And our youngest member of the family - Valeria. In September she is 14 years old. She goes to school, but now she is not learning. All say that this is a vacation...but I think this is a conspiracy!</p>

I will talk about e-books. What are the advantages and disadvantages? I am against with all of my paws! Book is not just a source of information. Book - is primary a soft and comfortable surface.
I love to learn! I love to learn «on» good books. The biger the book is, the better! This nice part is over. 
I like to lie on my bird’s books.</p> 
<p>On all books simultaneously! I can learn from morning till night, length and width, anxiety and serene. I am very capable! And the main: I hate e-books! This is barbarism! Sleep on their Kindles, tablets, laptops and computers yours! My whole body is sore from your English. Now it’s time to say goodbye. Everybody should make conclusions  and go to bookshops.</p>

That means «Hello» in Israel. I want to tell something about Israel. This is a very small and authentic country. There are many things which admire me. Israelis are very patient with babies (children or pets). They love them dearly! My favourite word in Hebrew: «Hamud». It means «good, funny, cute, charming». </p>
<p>The entire spectrum of positive! It is the magic word. It excuse all actions. I can swing on the curtains - «Hamud»! Sharpen claws on the furniture - «Hamud»! Wake up my owners by the morning meow - anyway «Hamud»!</p>

<p>And you could envy me...Only my owners - Russian!!! You understand the whole meaning of the tragedy?! My owners consider it insubordination authority and punish according to the laws of the revolutionary time. I must be «Hamud»! I am on the territory of Israel! I am excited! And yes, in Hebrew it sounds: «Ani mudag»... 
No, no, and no! I say, well as you can?!</p>

How much names do you have?! How many names  are enough for one living being? I have hundreds of names! It is not a diagnosis (multiple personalities). And I do not have many faces. Just my owners are idiots! Most likely, that after this post I will be punished... best case scenario. Most likely I will be awarded a new name, eg Pavlik Morozov.</p>
<p>Check out a few of my names: «Sidoroff» (when I will be punished), «Petr» (when I am brutal), 
«Fleas house» ( if I have itch ), «Serafima stupid» ( sometimes my face is not very intelligent. So what?). «Gunther» ( here it traced an allusion to the orientation. When they want to say my behaviour is not quite perfect ). </p>
<p>«Alfred» ( when I am very clever ), «Heel» ( I have furry heels. They are perfect! ), «Wool», «Fur Coat». 
«Angelina Jolie» (Due to allergies I have swollen lips. Thank you, my little mistress Valeria. You are a true daughter of her parents!)
«Redhead» ( If I am unbridled and uncontollable. I must admit, that name drives me crazy. )
My life is so sad... Why is my life so sad???
I will go cry.</p>

I want to continue the theme of Israel. When I hear  «Shabat shalom», I always know that today is Friday or Saturday. Usually, my week consists of two days.The first day in me week: «I have not eaten today»
The second day in my week: «Shabat shalom». This is a terrible time for me. 
I am not allowed to sleep all day. This is similar to a torture with fun. Israelis are very noisy people. Believe me, it is so. </p>
<p>After 15:00, working life stops and my life turns into a nightmare...
From all sides there will be dancing, songs, children’s laughter, karaoke, children’s cry and endless loud phone conversation. And it’s all very loud! My family is not like them. We are very quiet animals. So, when I hear «Shabat shalom» I want to kill myself!

What can you say about Ayurveda? Don’t tell me about harmony and continuous happiness. If I’ll hear about «chakras», «connection people with the Universe» - I will tear at mohair! I am serious!
How much you can mock an unhappy cat? When my owners bought Ayurvedic shampoo for animals, I was not expecting anything bad! I didn’t expect to get stabbed in the back! Oh My God! How could I be so naive?! </p>
<p>If you bought shampoo - use it for yourselves! It is a rule! Why would you bathe a live cat? Who invented it? Show me the man and I will tear at mohair with all of my paws!
I do not know how I survived! But I know for sure - Three doshas system did not worked! Get out with your Ayurveda! How terrible to live!</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi there!</br>
What do you like to do in leisure time? Don’t tell me that apart from work you don’t see anything! I’ll never believe it! I am really busy, but I find time in my schedule to rest. Nothing is impossible! If you can’t find what to do in leisure time, I will help you. Leisure time - this is when you lie on the couch and think about meat. You think about meat? You think about meat, as I think about it? If I am not thinking about meat, it would not exist! I love when my owners pet me. The belly, the neck, or whole body.  I love to sniff the air. I love standing up on hind legs and sniffing the air. </p>
<p>But, most of all, I love to lie on the kitchen cabinet under the ceiling. If you look at my avatar, you will understand what I mean! Do you enjoy lying on cabinets? Sometimes, I can sleep there...and my owners nervously search for me. It’s very funny to watch! And a few more interesting things that I love...maybe you will like to do it: lying in the cupboard or in the box, to hide under a blanket, licking packages, catching soap bubles, carrying a toy in my mouth. Try it! I am sure, you will like it! And do not say that you are too busy. You’re just lazy!</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi guys!</br>
Thank you for reading my journal. Today, I want to 
talk about TV-series. And do not tell me, that you’re above this! That TV series are garbage! You dissemble. I am not ashamed to admit, I like Tv-series. My favourite series are about guts. And do not wince! My favourite list: «Criminal Minds», «Rizzoli & Isles», «Without a Trace», «Diagnosis : Murder», «House M.D», «Crossing Jordan», «Body of Proof».</p> 
<p>I would like to be a detective or medical examiner. I would say sagely,
The victim has dying fractures. My assistant would repeat after me «fractures were gained while self-defencing». Everybody would trust to my experiece. I would have advised on different question. </p>
<p>Eg: «Professor Felix, what do you think about hippocampus?» or «Judging from cranial structure , the victim was a woman. And I say more... She was a teacher. I can say it because of the pointer sticking out of her cranium.»
If I was a detective, I would’ve studied the offender profile. I’d sit in my office, smoking and thinking, and everyone would be writing my ideas... « The killer understands human anatomy. He is not very strong, because he fought with the victim ». I think, I’d be good at it!</p>

Animals have feelings too! My dear owner Alexander, just so you know - I’m offended at you! You have not bought me yesterday for any money. How could you say that,«buy yourself another cat?! My Bird selling me every day to other family members,  more than once daily. But they are not buying me. But yesterday, I haven’t been bought very rudely. Why, my owner? After all, you’re my owner! My owner! 
How could you? I’m back to the wall... </p>
<p>I don’t know how you can  apologize! New cat will never be like me! Maybe, she will be not fluffy enough, not so clever, not imposing... I do not know her, but I don’t approve of your choise! By the way, «One love, one nation!»</p>
<p>Not yours Felix</p>

How do you tolerate heat? How do you help yourself on hot days? 
Housekeeping tip: If you are very hot, I recommended you lay in the sink. It always helps  me. Body temperature drops and life is getting better. </p>
<p>If this method does not suit it, you need to lie on the floor opposite the blowing device. It may be conditioner or fan, wind will blow your hair and belly. If you  do this and it does not help - go to tundra! And stop bothering me with silly questions.</p>

In this beautiful morning, I would like to talk about education. How you educate your owners? Or, let’s  ask this question differently... Do you educate them at all? How to achieve complete obedience from the owners and consecutive execution of instruction? Or is it a mith? 
I can’t achieve obedience from them! Training animals is easier... </p>
<p>They live with me for 6 years already. And? And they have mastered a few commands in 6 years! What are the commands? «Felix is hungry»  and «Felix is sick». Primitive creatures! Now... about to nature of the problem... At some point, they have lost logical chain. They desided that there’s a direct relations between eating and my illness... Who would have thought that everything will be so sad? How to fix them? Do cynoligists for the owners exist? </p>

What is an astral connection? Why do you say that? Do you believe it? I feel something like that with meat.
I can sleep and will feel in a dream they are going to cook meat. After a second I’ll yell and demand meat. If you ignore my cry, I will move on to the ultrasound, your ears will suffer  from this. </p>
<p>Here it means a real astral connection, because I and meat are inseparable! These are true feelings! And not those of yours... I thought about it, it called! Wow! What a sacrilege!</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi!</br>
Let’s talk about the harm of study. Because it takes all free time, you could spend usefully.
I hate, when my «Bird» learns. It’s true! She all time is busy.  It’s just unbearable! 
She looks like a train, only with the books. All the time in a hurry.  She has some crazy plan. 
And what about me? For who I have to sing? Who will stroke me and say that I’m the Best Cat in The World? 
Who will play with me? I suffer very much from her study! It must somehow be stopped! Evil must be punished! </p>
<p>She need to learn useful things, in my opinion! For example: «How to please a cat», «Testing new foods», «Buffet breakfast for the cat», «Throat singing a duet with your cat», «Tour to the factory of meat products», «Scare the mice by turns »...
Here’s hat you need to learn, and no nonsense!</p>

I will talk about professions. Whoever you never want to work? Do you dislike representatives of what professions? I hate veterinaries! What?
Have you ever visited veterinaries? Well, how do you like it? When I was brought to the vet, I wasn't waiting anything good from the visit. Moreover, I start to have cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the visit, all decent. Vet stroking me, talking to me politely, scratching my belly... and suddenly he captures me and measures the temperature. Don’t even ask where! He does me vaccinations, takes blood on the analysis... Vets, I hate you! You are nonhumans!
I’ll never be like you.</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi, my dear friends!</br>
How’s life? If I remember correctly, yesterday we talked about the professions and unloved professions. You are ready to proceed?
I would never work as a loader. Believe it or not, but I’m afraid of loaders and everything related to them. That’s one more job I wouldn’t do! When they came to us, I was hiding in a cabinet or under the bed. You know, it’s very, very scary! Just imagine, you quietly live and suddenly... 
You hear the sounds of crashing, shouting and only later they come...</p>
<p>Loaders! As if on purpose, they create an atmosphere of a horror movie. Your heart skips a beat every sound. You feel the pulse of each of my paws. Every sound they come closer and closer... If I were a dog, I would bark at them. But I am a cat! 
I worthily behave in stressful situations. I am hiding, trembling, afraid and lose appetite.
As far as to professions, my most favourite work - the work of a cat! Till next time!</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi, there!</br>
I want to tell you about my second love. You know my first love, it is food. My second 
love is boxes! Did you know, that cats are highly compact? We can fit in a box of any size. And it will be convenient! You can check. Take any box, go up to it and slowly lay down. Cats have a rule, if one part of a cat can fit, therefore, the whole cat can fit. By the way, when I was a child I loved lying in a pencil case. </p>
<p>My little mistress had a very comfortable and beautiful pencil case. I liked it very much! I was lying in it, although it only fit a part of the ear and head.
Do you remember about the rule of compactness, right?
Till tomorrow.</p>

Every highly developed cat needs to talk about literature.
When I become old and hoary, I will organize literary evenings. Maybe even begin to smoke a pipe.
Yes! Exactly so! Excuse me, I digress. Pushkin: 
«Perhaps an active man should engage<br>
With the question of the beauty of his nails.»<br>
Believe it or not, but in short about scratching posts. I hate the official accessories for animals! Usually, they are not comfortable. </p>
<p>Manufacturers think that we all are the same, but we are not! 
I like to sharpen claws on a vertical surfaces, and it should be higher than my height. It’s comfortable for me. Seeing my sufferings, my owners presented me a big suitcase. Suitcase - is a very comfortable scratching post. I’m very-very happy! I love my owners and they love me!</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi!</br>
I’ll start with a question. What do you see outside the window? I like to look out of the window and  sniff the air. What smell does the air have  for you? My air smells of  sea and freshness. And barbecue... It smells of barbecue only on Shabat. Fortunately only Shabat!</p>
<p>The whole beach cooks meat...a lot of meat...mountains of meat! In Hebrew it’s called «Basar al esh». Today the air is very fresh and I like it!
I enjoyed talking with you. Thank you for attention.</p>

We already talked about literature and weather.
Today, I will discuss culture news. 
The theme will be slightly piquant... I’ll start from a distance. I live in capacious apartment. Additional comforts of our apartment is a safety room and a laundry room. Safety-room is the bomb shelter. I can tell you about it another time.
In the laundry-room there is a washing mashine, household chemicals  and my toilet. </p>
<p>Laundry and laundry... But you already know my owners...and you should understand that in our family not everything is simple. 
They call laundry room «The Ministry of Culture» and they are laughing very loud. I dont know this anecdote, but it offends me. People, what is this?</p>

How are you? How are you keeping? I will continue talking about Israeli life.Today, I want to talk about the safety-room. What is it and what are they? Usually, when the siren is heard, all people need to run for cover. In modern houses one of the rooms is built with special technology. 
I’m not a builder, so can’t tell you in detail about room strengthening technologies, but the room looks impressive, trust me. </p>
<p>And so, if the siren is heard, you must be in the room. Lower the metal shield in the window and close the metal door.
I am very afraid of the sound of a siren. It is very loud and with every second it is getting louder and louder...At some point it seems like  my guts are on a fork, like spaghetti. It’s very scary, believe me. Thank you for your kind attention.</p>

In childhood, when I was sick or scared, I slept with my bird on her head. I grew and grew...and finally grew. But my bird and her head remains the same size. It is very sad. Now, when I need care, I can’t lie on her head. This is unfair! Why people don’t grow together with pets, proportionally with its size? Most likely you’re going to tell me: </p>
<p>«Felix, are you out of you mind!» But if the pet is a horse or a cow, how big a person should be?
On the other hand, what to do if your pet is a hamster or canary? How to be smaller? And this is a very stupid question! You don’t need to be smaller! You just need to learn to control the size of the owners to the need of the pets. What have you wanted? Animals are a big responsibility!</p>

Today, I woke up and loudly demanded pate. I will not hide, I was tedious and nasty! At first they  threw pillows at me and then I was fed. And then I thought about reaction rate. No,no... With my speed everything is alright, but my owners would do well to speed up! If I had a violin...everything could be otherwise! Nothing would be worse than violin sounds in awkward hands. </p>
<p>I would ruthlessly play a violin until I get pate!And while I am hungry, your ears will suffer as much as I do, and even more!So be it! </p>
<p class="avtograf">Buy a violin. Immediately. Cheaply.Give me two! Brutal Felix</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi, there! How are you?</br>
Now it’s very fashionable to write different facts about yourself. As you know, I am a cat in the trend!
So I joined  the collective madness. </p>
<ol start = "1">
		<li>I have many names.</li>
		<li>My owners are very fond of me.</li>
		<li>I’m allergic to fleas.</li>
		<li>I love when people are singing with bad voice.</li>
		<li>I don’t like to stay at home alone. </li>
		<li>I drink antidepressants. When my Bird worked, I was sad and lonely...I had a hair problem. My belly and legs were completely naked. A veterinarian prescribed me antidepressants and it helped me.</li>
		<li>I never crapped past the toilet. Even after anesthesia I crawled to my toilet only on forepaws. Despite the fact that my owners bought me diapers for pets. I am very neat.</li>
		<li>I don’t stink. In our apartment we don’t have cat odor.</li>
		<li>I have a lot of toys.</li>
		<li>I’m cool!</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for all. Till next time.</p>

Today I want to tell about my little mistress. As I already said, her name is Valeria. 
I love her very much! Although she grabs me all the time. When she was little, she was very fond of the holidays. We were celebrating birthdays of all her toys... On holidays there had to be a cake! No other way! My Bird always understands the madness of people. So, we had many holidays.
Someday If you open firm for organization of holidays... Never, Never! You hear me? </p>
<p>Do not have a business with toys or toy owners! They are merciless! My Bird is  good and understanding up to a certain limit. But if she reaches the boiling point, better to stay away from her. It is best to live the country, to change your name and gender. So it is even better!
So here, when all toys ...and their friends ...and neighbors holidays are over... Bird said sternly : «That’s it! We need a break from the holidays. Now only the ceramics and ballet!» All the alert...Because it was the moment when it’s time to change your country. The continuation of this story will be tomorrow...</p>

Well, we continue...
But Valeria is stubborn! 
She doesn’t give up!
And the next day, Lera informed: 
«Today is the birthday of my dog-toy!» My Birds said: «Ok! But it will be quite another holiday!». 
Valeria asked: «What holiday?» And Bird said: «It will be a funeral». Because your toys had too much birthdays and that means, your toys have become very old... I'm afraid, they will not survive another birthday. So, who will we bury? Dog?»</p>
<p>Valeria was at a loss. She couldn’t believe  that everything will turn out like that. Understood that Bird wasn’t joking, and the dog needs to be saved... She found the way out...Hiding the toy behind herself, says : «It’s a birthday of another dog. The birthday of the dog-sister! We are not familiar with her yet. But she really wants a holiday.» My Bird thought and said: «Well, if you really want it...Then of course. We will celebrate.  It's the best time to meet with dog-sister ». So we got a new family member. And if anyone wants  a celebration, he simply says: «Today is the birthday of the dog-sister!»</p>

I will be brief. Newsletter of the weekend:
«Pope Franciskus visited the shelter for former prostitutes. Pope was in a shelter for an hour . Franciscus called modern human trafficking -  «Crime against humanity.» He expressed the hope, that all women would be able to start a new life... and wished them «to be strong»» And that’s it? </p>
<p>He had not even prayed for them? What did he did there for an hour? May be these words were spoken: «You endure here. All the best, have a good mood and health!»?</p>

My fantasy has ended...What do I have to write, when I have nothing to write about? Nothing interesting happens. And it’s not bad! We with Bird don’t like unplanned events. It’s demoralizing us. 
Once I was taken to to the vet adventitiously. And was castrated....
A seemingly ordinary winter morning in  Moscow... and who thought this was a good idea?
In short: Surprises are bad! </p>
<p>And it does not matter that they are pleasant or unpleasant.
This is the way I look at it! In conclusion, I’d like to say something, but I have nothing to say.
That’s all for today.</p>

I am delighted to inform you that the school year begins soon!
My Bird and Valeria are carrying home something all the time. They are buying textbooks,  accessories and other useless things for me. Certainly, It would be better If they bought me pates... For the entire academic year! I would wake up with joy, and would went in the kitchen to learn...
I would be the best student! Back to the news...</p>
<p>Why am I so happy even without the pate? Because Valeria is going to  school! And I can be the owner of her room almost all day ! 
I’ll sleep on her bed, jump out of bed on a computer desk, lie on the couch and in the cupboard. 
And when she is back from school, I’ll shout loud from the other side of the door: «Meow! Get out! Go to your school! I just started to get used to my room!» And she says: «Felix, you cried...you was bored, my baby. Me too.»</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi!</br>
We lived in another house some time ago.
One family lived near us. They were all cursing constantly. We found out that they were in relationship and they were  dissatisfied with something. But in some way my Bird has been with them in good terms. Mom was mostly a brawler. Her name was Bertha. You be all ears? I get to the point... Usual sound environment in that house: Bertha (neighbor on the right) swearing. </p>
<p>Bubu (bottom neighbor) makes furniture. We listened all day: «Children are crying. Morris (upstairs neighbor) prays. Morris dances after prayers. Morris is in a trance (he dances and sings). Morris is energetic (he dances, sings and moves the chairs)...» The continuation of this story will be tomorrow...</p>

			<p class="indent">Hi!</br>
Well, we continue... Bubu was in a small business... He made furniture. What does it mean? Bubu saws. Bubu is using an electrofret. And...Bubu does not work alone! He has helpers. Oh yeah, these guys are love power tools! You already understand, what I mean? </p>
<p>Eli Cohen Street ...Anytime... Sound accompaniment: Saws sound. Squawk Bertha...Bertha subsides... Bubu off saw. Bird concludes that Bertha was sawn... Now, when we hear on TV the sound of saws and cries, we call it: «Wow, reporting from the streets of Eli Cohen» or a «Movie about Bertha».</p>

A fresh selection of news. 
Ball lightning takes revenge on children. One child from Tula contused. Child killed in Yamal.
What is that? We tamed the peaceful atom! We are launching a rocket into space! But here it is ...What you can do with this stuff? Nothing? Just sit back and be afraid of? News number two: «Unhappy Chinese woman can in no way give birth At all! Completely! For 17 months!» Woman started to go to the hospital every 7-10 days. Examinations were performed on 14 week. </p>
<p>At 14 weeks, Carl! And... Doctors have excluded the possibility of surgery ...drumroll... Because the child is not yet sufficiently developed.
Oh really? He hasn’t learned the periodic table and hasn’t proved Fermat's theorem yet? Dumbass! Stupid, stupid baby! Usually, without doctoral dissertation no one is born. Somehow not accepted... Or is he not very well developed physically? He didn’t start to walk yet? Haven’t passed Ladder on swimming? I haven’t words...</p>

I want to tell how I was offended... What do you think, who wronged me? Of course, my Bird! Yes Yes! Read attentively!
Let everyone know what are you! And what they can do with the unnecessary cats!
Sometimes I want to get out of the apartment. But it is forbidden because I am a house cat! It is strictly forbidden! But if I want something I aspire to get this. And you act differently? Really?</p>
<p>Outside the door of our apartment there is a lift. I don’t like the sound of the lift. I'm afraid of it. All week I wanted to walk outside the door
If someone entered in  apartment, half of the cat was already outside the door. I was persistent and my bird was in a rage. She grabbed me roughly, walked out door and called the lift. Don’t even ask me
how I survived it! Now when I go to the door, Bird asks me If I want to walk...
Bird, you're cruel animal! Know that!</p>

			<p class="indent">Hello!</br>
Here I am! I wrote 10 facts about myself. But I forgot to write one more important fact.
Who washes the floor better than anyone in the flat? Of course it’s me! I love to drink fresh water. Always fresh!
When I drink, I dip a paw in the water and begin to wash the floor around the bowls. I am trying very hard! No one cleans the floor as often. </p>
<p>Because I am  very neat! By the way, the water should be replaced immediately! When the floor is absolutely clean, I can wash a wall or a cabinet. My Bird says that she will move the water bowl around the apartment...I will resist this!</p>
